As we dive deeper into the world of programming, we come across some concepts that seem extremely complex and difficult to understand. It turns out that all these concepts are just abstractions from our day-to-day lives and as soon as we realize this, everything becomes easier - or at least simpler - to be understood. Let's take a quick look at the relationship between AuthN and OAuth 2.0 and some of the main elements that make up what we call Open Authorization - or OAuth for short.
